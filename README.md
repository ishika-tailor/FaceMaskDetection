# FaceMaskDetection
Purpose: Construct a CNN model to detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not with your webcam or mobile camera.

•	In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. 
•	Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

•	In these tough COVID-19 times, wouldn’t it be satisfying to do something related to it? we decided to build a very simple and basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow with Keras library and OpenCV to detect if you are wearing a face mask to protect yourself. Interesting! Isn’t it?
